        <p>We are a group (of one person) dedicated to do any kind of thing to get a good grade for delivering this project.</p>
        <p>That is why we called the site "Merequetengue", because the ups and downs of learning Django and its advantages.</p>
        <p>
        "Fandango" is just another kind of merequetengue, so its very suitable for the name of our main application. Also
        because the name describes the plurality of a Blog site, in which many people publishes many topics, which will be
        equivalent to a party (a fandango) with many people talking at the same time about many things.
        </p>
        <p>
        Faithful to Mexican tradition, we are calling our blog posts "Pegostes", which is a kind of messing thing to do,
        thus authors are our "Pegosteadores".
        </p>
        <p>
        Hopefully, you will find this fandango of pegostes in a merequetengue of your liking.
